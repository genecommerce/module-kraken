# Kraken Image Optimisation

This module will optimise all images uploaded to products pages & CMS pages through Kraken, saving vital disk space and increasing page load speeds. 

You can optimise existing images using the `bin/magento gene:kraken:optimise [directory]` command. Be sure to take a backup of the directory first as the module will overwrite the existing files.

## Requirements
1) A [Kraken](https://kraken.io/) account
2) Read/write access to the pub/ directory
